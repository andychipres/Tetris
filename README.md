Tetris Game
This is a simple Tetris game implemented in C#.

## Controls
Z: Rotate the blocks.
C: Hold blocks.
Spacebar: Automatically drop blocks all the way down.
How to Play
Run the game executable (e.g., TetrisGame.exe).
The game will start, and you will see the Tetris grid and the current falling block.
Use the Z key to rotate the falling block clockwise.
Press the C key to hold the current block, if desired.
Press the Spacebar to instantly drop the falling block all the way down to the lowest possible position.
The game will automatically detect when a row is completely filled with blocks and clear it.
Your goal is to prevent the Tetris grid from filling up completely by clearing as many rows as possible.
The game ends when a new falling block cannot enter the grid because it is obstructed by other blocks.

When the game ends, you will see your final score.
Press any key to restart the game.
