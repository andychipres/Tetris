Tetris Game
This is a simple Tetris game implemented in C#.

## Controls

## How to Play
1. Run the game executable (e.g., <strong> TetrisGame.exe </strong>).

3. Use the <strong> Z </strong> key to rotate the falling block clockwise.
4. Press the <strong> C </strong> key to hold the current block, if desired.
